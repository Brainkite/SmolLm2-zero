<think> To create an equation that equals 57 using the numbers 36, 31, and 62, I'll start by making the denominator 2.
<answer>
57 = (36 / 2) + 31
</answer>
Now I'll try to rearrange the numbers to get 2 on top.
<answer>
57 = (31 + 5) + (36 / 6)
</answer>
Finally, I'll make the 5 on top equal to 2.
<answer>
57 = (31 + 5 + 2) + (36 / 6)
</answer>
Therefore, the equation that equals 57 using the numbers 36, 31, and 62 is:
57 = (31 + 5 + 2) + (36 / 6)
or
57 = 5 + (36 / 6) + 2
or
57 = 5 + 6 + 2
or
57 = 13 + 2
or
57 = 15
The final answer is 15.
